# 🧪 Test Build Locally to Catch Errors

## ✅ Why Test Locally?

**Netlify shows the same errors you'll see locally!**

If you can't get the full Netlify log, test the build on your Mac to see the exact error.

## 📋 Steps

### Step 1: Open Terminal

**On Mac:**
- Press `Cmd + Space`
- Type "Terminal"

### Step 2: Navigate to Project

```bash

### Step 4: Check Output

**Look for:**
- `Failed to compile`
- `SyntaxError:`

### Step 5: Share the Error

**Copy the error message and share it here!**
